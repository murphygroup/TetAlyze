Description:
	LWP is a Matlab/Octave toolbox implementing Locally Weighted
	Polynomial regression. With this toolbox you can fit local
	polynomials of any degree using kernels with metric window widths or
	nearest neighbor window widths to data of any dimensionality. A
	function for optimization of the kernel bandwidth is also available.
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 8.6 (R2015b) and
	Octave version 4.0.0.

Installation (for Matlab):
	Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
	"Add with subfolders" button and select the LWP folder in the
	file dialog. Press the Save button in order to save your changes
	to the Matlab search path. The toolbox is now installed. Have fun.
